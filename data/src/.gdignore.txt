this is where we will store the
models and animations

lets go shopping ;)

since this is just the start
well go with 4 to five or six
animations 

lets go with the basic
locomotion pack

that ill be all for the 
setup

now to merge animations follow along 
 



head over to where you stored the models
and animations

now add animations

so the steps include
* initialize character
* join animation
	note that all animations
	must be in the same folder
* add root motion
* name and export the file

now for the second one or our
main focus for the tutorial

there are more animations so it 
might take a while so with the
power of skipping
